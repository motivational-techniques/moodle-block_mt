These are test cases for block_mt_p_timeline



TEST CASE: Graph viewed in course with no enroled users
TO PASS: Graph shows only ideal timeline (or empty graph)

TEST CASE: Graph viewed before milestone data entered
TO PASS: Graph shows, but is empty, nothing along x-axis

TEST CASE: Graph viewed when ideal milestone data all 0
TO PASS: Graph shows, but is empty, nothing along x-axis

TEST CASE: Graph viewed with some milestones 0 or empty
TO PASS: Those that are 0/empty do not show while those that have values show

TEST CASE: Graph viewed with various milestone values (sequential and non-sequential)
TO PASS: Milestones are ordered by week value entered, line reflects values entered

TEST CASE: Milestone ideal week values entered less than 0, greater than 26, or non-numeric
TO PASS: The number reverts to its previous value when saved or cursor moved out of text box

TEST CASE: Graph viewed with only one milestone
TO PASS: Graph displays dot(s) instead of lines

TEST CASE: Graph viewed with many milestones (30+)
TO PASS: Graph displays milestone names, but not all, graph still looks about the same

TEST CASE: Graph viewed with disjointed milestone completion (quiz 1, 3, and 4 done, but not quiz 2)
TO PASS: Graph shows dot for disjoint milestone, but no lines to disjointed milestone, lines between others

TEST CASE: Graph viewed by teacher/admin
TO PASS: Graph shows ideal and average lines, nothing for "your progress"

TEST CASE: Graph viewed by student who has not reached any milestone
TO PASS: Graph shows ideal and average lines, nothing for "your progress"

TEST CASE: Graph viewed when average and your lines overlap
TO PASS: Your line (red) is on top of the average line (yellow)

TEST CASE: Graph viewed before and after quiz/assignment submitted (as draft)
TO PASS: Graph does not show milestone upon submission

TEST CASE: Graph viewed before and after quiz/assignment submitted
TO PASS: Graph does not show milestone upon submission

TEST CASE: Graph viewed before and after quiz/assignment marked
TO PASS: Graph now shows the new milestone with the correct week value, average line may move as well to account for new data

TEST CASE: Graph viewed with one milestone done
TO PASS: Graph shows dot at milestone

TEST CASE: Graph viewed with multiple milestones done
TO PASS: Graph shows lines between milestone dots, unless milestone is disjoint

TEST CASE: Cancel clicked in admin options after changes made to values, view again
TO PASS: Redirect to course page, no errors, changes were not saved

TEST CASE: Save changes clicked in admin options with no changes made to values, view again
TO PASS: Redirects to course page, no errors, empty values default to 0, others same as before

TEST CASE: Save changes clicked in admin options after changes made to values, view again
TO PASS: Redirects to course page, no errors, empty values default to 0, others show changed values

TEST CASE: Cancel clicked in student options (no options to save)
TO PASS: Redirect to course page, no errors

TEST CASE: Save changes clicked in student options (no options to save)
TO PASS: Same as cancel button, redirect to course page, no errors

TEST CASE: Turn editing on/off when viewing graph, this checks the internal $PAGE URL
TO PASS: Page refreshs without errors

TEST CASE: Turn editing on/off when viewing options, this checks the internal $PAGE URL
TO PASS: Page refreshs without errors

TEST CASE: View the graph with multiple users who all have data
TO PASS: Graph ideal and average lines remain the same, student line changes

TEST CASE: View graph, change ideal week values, view again
TO PASS: Average and student lines does not change, ideal line changes, has new values

TEST CASE: View graph, remove ideal week value(s), view again (set to 0)
TO PASS: All lines change to reflect missing milestone(s)

TEST CASE: View graph in multiple courses
TO PASS: Graph line change based on data for that course, no overlapping data

TEST CASE: View graph with multiple users
TO PASS: Graph line change based on data for that student, no overlapping data

TEST CASE: Use graph with both quizzes and assignments
TO PASS: Both types of module will be visible

TEST CASE: Use graph with other module types in course
TO PASS: No other module types show in graph, only quiz and assignment types

TEST CASE: Ideal timeline options are viewed in course with no content
TO PASS: Options page shows, but nothing there

TEST CASE: Options are viewed in course with no content, click save changes, nothing to save
TO PASS: Page redirects without errors

TEST CASE: Chart is viewed in course with no content, no data for chart
TO PASS: Chart shows, but there are no lines

TEST CASE: View chart, manually change the courseid value in the URL, go to page
TO PASS: If block is installed in that course and user is enroled in that course, chart will display, if block is not installed in that course, the page redirects to the user's dashboard, if the block is installed, but the user is not enroled, enrolment options page is shown

TEST CASE: View administrator options, manually change the courseid value in the URL, go to page
TO PASS: If block is installed in that course, and user is enroled in that course, options will display, if block is not installed in that course, the page redirects to the user's dashboard, if the block is installed, but the user is not enroled, enrolment options page is shown

TEST CASE: View student options, manually change the courseid value in the URL, go to page
TO PASS: If block is installed in that course, and user is enroled in that course, options will display, if block is not installed in that course, the page redirects to the user's dashboard, if the block is installed, but the user is not enroled, enrolment options page is shown

TEST CASE: Add assessment to course page, give ideal time value, view chart
TO PASS: New assessment shows in chart

TEST CASE: Remove assessment from course page, view chart
TO PASS: Removed assessment no longer shown on chart, may not happen immediately, appears to be a caching problem and will self correct

TEST CASE: Remove assessment from course page, view settings for ideal times, click cancel/save
TO PASS: Removed assessment no longer shown in settings, may not happen immediately, appears to be a caching problem and will self correct
